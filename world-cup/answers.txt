Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations increases, the program's predictions become more accurate. However,
in the initial simulations, the program's predictions are less accurate and can have some incorrect
predictions just like the first prediction.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It depends on the level of accuracy needed for the predictions to be considered "good enough".
As we increase the number of simulations, the predictions become more accurate. However, there
is a tradeoff between accuracy and computation time/cost. So how bouyant one is might actually
affect the number of simulation one does.

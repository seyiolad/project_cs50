The listener's audio aura could be described as energetic and lively if the songs in the database have high tempo,
fast-paced rhythms, and upbeat moods. Conversely, if the songs are slow with melancholic melodies and sad lyrics,
the listener's audio aura could be characterized as melancholic and reflective. However, it's important to acknowledge
that characterizing a listener's audio aura based on a single database of top 100 songs from a specific year may not
be fully representative of their overall music preferences or audio preferences in general.

There are better ways to calculate a listener's audio aura, such as analyzing a more extensive sample of songs
from different genres and time periods, taking into account additional features beyond audio features, like the
listener's emotional responses to music, and context in which they listen to music (e.g., while working out, studying,
relaxing, etc.). Additionally, using machine learning techniques can help identify patterns and associations between
different audio features and the listener's overall preferences.
